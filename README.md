## Variables

###Assign a variable like so:

```
str = 12
bronze = "Josh sure is bronze!"
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

###You can use define variables to use them later in your code

```
str = 12
rts = 32

return str + rts
return str * rts
return rts / str
return str - rts
```

###There are many types of variables, such as:

* Integers
* String
* Arrays

##Conditionals

###You can create expressions with if statements like so:

if x == 123
```
    return True

if str[0:13] == "Josh is bronze"
```
    return False
```
if a[0] == 3
```
    return True

###Branches are related lines of code:

if str[0: 4] == 13
```
    return True
```
The return true part of this line of code is a branch.

##Functions

##You define a function like so:
```
def func(a,b):
```
The "func" part is the name of the function. The "a, b" part are the parameters. Once you define the function, the parameters are the variables you enter into the function to recieve an output. For example:
```
def func(a, b):
    return a + b
print func(1, 3)
```
When you run this function, it will return 4, since you defined the function to output the sum of the 2 numbers inputted.
